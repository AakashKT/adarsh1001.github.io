<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name, as you can probably guess from the title of the page, is <em>Adarsh Pal Singh</em>. I'm currently pursuing BE in <em>Electronics
and Telecommunication</em> at Army Institute of Technology, Pune (University of Pune). </p>
<p>I purchased this domain name recently. I don't usually get a lot of free time but when I do, I'll definitely work and make
this page into a real classy website using HTML & CSS. </P>
<p><strong>Cheers!</strong>
